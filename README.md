4) Images: contains site Images
5) js: contains javascript dependencies
5) less: contains less dependencies (used for styling)

2) index.html (site hompage)
3) membership.html ( contains members of the NGO)
4) mission.html (contains the NGO's mission)
5) programs.html (contains NGO's schedule of activities)
